     <br>
      <p><em>My family recently rescued a Pitbull - we named him Shamrock. Of the handful of dogs I've owned, Shamrock is by far the most loyal of breeds. Unfortunately, many label these beautiful animals agressive due to a select few irresponsible owners. This couldn't be further from the truth. This page not only serves as my first coding assignment, but to educate you about the realities of owning a Pitbull...Enjoy!</em></p>

      <p>The American Pit Bull is medium-sized, and has a short coat and smooth well-defined muscle structure. Its eyes are round to almond-shaped, and its ears are small to medium in length, typically half prick or rose in carriage. The tail is slightly thick and tapers to a point. The coat is glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch. Any color, color pattern, or combination of colors is acceptable, both the ADBA and UKC do not recognize merle coloring. Color patterns that are typical in the breed are spotted, brindled, solid, and with points.</p>

      <p>The cross of Bulldog and Terrier was called by several names, including Bull-and-Terrier Dog, "Pit Bull Terrier"(Bull terrier used to fight on pit), or Half and Half. Later, it assumed the name of Staffordshire Bull Terrier in England. These dogs began to find their way into America as early as 1850. Became a new breed and was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 10 February, 1898, with the name American pit bull terrier. In 1936 some pit bulls were accepted for registration in the American Kennel Club (AKC) Stud Book as Staffordshire Terriers with a new standard and purpose, belonging to the terrier and molosser groups.</p>

     <h3>American Bully</h3>
      <img class="img-responsive thumbnail" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/AmericanBully.jpg">
       <p>Founded in the United States between 1980 and 1990, the American Bully was produced using a foundation of American Staffordshire Terriers and American Pit Bull Terriers bred to several bulldog-type breeds. It was created with the purpose of being a family companion dog. While some of the founding kennels, namely Razor's Edge owner Dave Wilson, affirmed that they used only the two first aforementioned breeds to produce the desired dogs, it is speculated that five other breeds were used to attain the more "bully" physical traits desired. These are assumed to be the American Bulldog, English Bulldog, Olde English Bulldogge, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and French Bulldog.</p>

     <h3>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</h3>

       <p>The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a medium-sized, stocky, and very muscular dog, with a similar appearance to the much larger American Staffordshire Terrier and American Pit Bull Terrier. The coat is smooth and clings tightly to the body giving the dog a streamlined appearance. This dog has a broad, wedge-shaped head (male considerably more so than female), defined occipital muscles, a relatively short fore-face, dark round eyes and a wide mouth with a clean scissor-like bite (the top incisors slightly overlap the bottom incisors).</p>
