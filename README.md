My second freecodecamp.org project - a very basic informational website compiled in Bootstrap, using very little CSS. Feel free to use it as a template. 

This project was completed using Codepen. You can view it here: https://codepen.io/ammcnei/pen/gxwWQp

I used the Bootstrap and Animate Font libraries:
